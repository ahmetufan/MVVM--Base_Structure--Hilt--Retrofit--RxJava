# MVVM--Base_Structure--Hilt--Retrofit--RxJava
Example application for hilt and retrofit structure

# Built With  :hammer_and_wrench:

•	[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - The language used in the Project<br/>
• [Dependency injection-Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.<br/> 
•	[MVVM Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzqSWBhDPARIsAK38LY_eKkftD-Fw99r1XQ_MZl6-jvmqOl4DNXadMjXYG6MpiQP4vY-8gZQaAoPCEALw_wcB) (View - ViewModel - Model)<br/>
• [Base Structure](https://proandroiddev.com/baseactivity-and-basefragment-are-monsters-5cda31639938) - Structure used for “Reusability” when writing code<br/>
•	[Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Used with LiveData in order to attach data to the activity/fragment lifecycle<br/>
•	[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Used to make data be Lifecycle aware, and helps persist data through the activity Lifecycle<br/>
•	[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.<br/>
• [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.<br/>
•	[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) Component - handle everything needed for in-app navigation.<br/>
•	[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Used to simplify networking<br/>
•	[RxJava](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rxjava-for-android/) - RxJava simplifies complex threading operations, maintaining proper synchronization as you switch seamlessly from thread to thread.<br/>
